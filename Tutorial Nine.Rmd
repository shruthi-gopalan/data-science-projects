```{r}
library(tidyverse)
artists <- read_csv("https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/blob/master/Artists.csv?raw=true")
art <- read_csv("https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection/blob/master/Artworks.csv?raw=true")%>%
  separate(ConstituentID, into = c("firstID", "secondID"), sep = ",", convert = TRUE)
```

```{r}
artists%>%
  select(ConstituentID)

art
#Primary Key: Constituent ID
```
```{r}
inner_join(artists,art,by = c("ConstituentID" = "firstID"))
```
```{r}
inner_join(artists,art,by = c("ConstituentID" = "secondID"))
```
Second ID has much higher constituent IDs, because not every piece of art has a second ID, but every piece has a first ID, therefore it is better to use first ID.

```{r}
right_join(artists,art,by = c("ConstituentID" = "firstID"))
```
```{r}
artists%>%
  select(DisplayName,Nationality)

```
