Exercise 2.25

```{r message = FALSE, warning= FALSE}
library(Stat2Data)
library(readr)
library (mosaic)
library(Stat2Data)
library(dplyr)
library(car)

data("Sparrows")
head(Sparrows)
```
```{r}
model1 = lm(Weight~WingLength, data= Sparrows)
summary(model1)
```
```{r}
plot(model1)
```
```{r}
anova(model1)
```
Anova Test. The Null hypothesis is that B1 = 0, the alternative hypothesis is the B1 is not equal 0. 
Given that the p-value 2.2e-16 is significant, we can reject the null hypothesis.


This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
