1. Create a list of matchups for teams numbered 1 to 6, where team 1 plays team 2, 3 plays 4 etc. Each matchup should be a vector, e.g. c(1, 2) is the first element of the list.
```{r}
games <- list(c(1, 2), c(3, 4), c(5, 6))
games
```
2. Using a for loop randomly choose winners from each matchup, saving the output into a new list called win
```{r}
win <- vector(mode = "list", length = 3)
for (j in 1:length(games)){
  win[[j]] <- sample(games[[j]],size = 1)
}
```
3. Display the win list
```{r}
win
```
